This project opens a specified page on Album of the Year, an album rating website, and parses individual pages to harvest:

1. The album name
2. The artist name
3. The compiled critic rating
4. The compiled user rating

The locations designated for scraping can be altered and different variables (genre or year for example) can be utilized to fetch different datasets of album lists by changing the destinations to be scraped respectively. 

The purpose of this instrument is to be able to quickly compile lists of albums based on the criteria given and can be further refined to collect lists of other albums on this website by altering minor pieces of the code.

One it finds the page to be harvested, it pulls the entire source code from the individual pages and further parses them for the individual albums with their associated variables as listed above. 

This is the first step of my ultimate plan to create a web application that recommends you an album to listen to on a daily basis, based on input given from previous albums.
